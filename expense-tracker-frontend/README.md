## Responsive Navbar

This project now uses a custom, production-ready Navbar component (`src/Navbar.js`) styled exclusively with Tailwind CSS and the Minimal Neutrals palette:

- **Primary:** #4B5563 (Slate Gray)
- **Secondary:** #9CA3AF (Light Gray)
- **Accent:** #2563EB (Blue)
- **Background:** #F9FAFB (Lightest Gray)
- **Success:** #10B981 (Emerald Green)
- **Error:** #EF4444 (Red)

### Features

- Responsive: Desktop/tablet shows full nav, mobile uses a hamburger menu with a slide-in overlay.
- Accessible: Keyboard and screen reader friendly.
- Navigation links: Dashboard, Expenses, Categories, Profile, Logout.
- Clean, modern look with smooth transitions and correct color usage.

### Customization

- To change navigation links, edit the `NAV_LINKS` and `USER_LINKS` arrays in `src/Navbar.js`.
- To customize colors, update your `tailwind.config.js` to include the Minimal Neutrals palette for easy class usage.

### Integration

- The Navbar is imported and rendered at the top of the app in `src/App.js`.
- The old header/nav and React logo have been removed for a cleaner, more professional UI.

## Modern Login/Signup UI

- The Login/Signup form now features a modern, responsive UI with a global dark/light theme toggle (üåô/‚òÄÔ∏è button, persists in localStorage).
- The theme toggle is now a global button in the top right corner of the screen on the login/signup page, with persistent theme preference in localStorage. This improves accessibility and visual consistency. The toggle is no longer inside the form box.
- Loading spinners (using `react-spinners`) are shown on login and signup buttons during async actions.
- Input fields have improved focus effects and accessibility, with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.
- The color palette uses 'Minimal Neutrals':
  - Slate: #4B5563
  - Gray: #9CA3AF
  - Blue: #2563EB
- Dark mode is fully supported for all screens and components.
- All UI is responsive and accessible.

## Navigation Bar

- A persistent navigation bar (Navbar) is shown for authenticated users.
- Navigation links: Dashboard, Expenses, Profile (with active state indicator).

- Logout button included in the Navbar.

## Expenses Summary, Sorting, and Filtering

## Toast Notifications

- Success and error messages in Expenses (e.g., adding expenses, uploading receipts) now use toast notifications via react-toastify.
- Toasts are styled to match the app's 'Minimal Neutrals' palette and are accessible and responsive.
- The notification system provides immediate feedback for user actions.
- Previous toast messages are automatically dismissed when new ones are triggered for a cleaner experience.

- Fully responsive design that integrates with the navigation system.

## Categories and Profile Components

- Categories component displays a polished placeholder UI for category management with loading indicators.
- Profile component shows account settings interface with similar placeholder design.
