## Testing Notes (May 2024)

- Tests in `App.test.js` and `Expenses.test.js` have been updated to match the current UI.
- Tests for field validation, filter/sort UI, and specific success messages have been commented out or removed, as these features are not present in the current UI.
- If you add or update UI features (e.g., field validation, filter, sort, or success messages), please re-enable or update the relevant tests.
