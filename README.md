# Expense Tracker - Cloud-Native Serverless Application

## Project Overview

A fully functional, cloud-native expense tracker with:

- **Backend**: Django API deployed on GCP Cloud Run
- **Frontend**: React app deployed on Firebase Hosting
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for secure user management
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB for expense storage
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for receipt uploads
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment

> **Note:** This README is the single source of documentation for both backend and frontend. The previous frontend/README.md has been merged here for clarity and maintainability.

- **Expenses**: Add, list, and filter expenses by category; sort by date/amount; upload receipts; toast notifications for feedback; loading spinners; all UI fully responsive and accessible.
- **Categories & Profile**: Polished placeholder UIs for category management and account settings, with loading indicators and consistent card visuals.
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error toasts via react-toastify, styled to match the app, accessible, and auto-dismissed.
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus rings, and screen reader support throughout.
- **Dark Mode**: Persistent, global toggle with smooth transitions and full support across all screens.
- **Visual Polish**: Centered layout, max-width containers, modern color palette, smooth transitions, sticky navbar, and improved table/card design.

### Password Reset Flow (Frontend)

The password reset modal uses a three-step process:

1. **Enter Email:** User enters their email to request a reset code.
2. **Enter Code:** User enters the code sent to their email. The code is verified before proceeding.
3. **Enter New Password:** If the code is valid, the user can set a new password (with real-time validation and requirements).

Only one message (error or success) is shown at a time for clarity.
